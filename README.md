      -a        If using Bash, asynchronously execute remote CUBEs/COMMANDs.
      -b        If using Bash, install programmable tab completion for SSH hosts.
      -c CUBE   Execute a cube. Option may be specified multiple times. If COMMANDS
                are also specified, cubes are run first.
      -d        Print debugging information.
      -D CMD    Use `CMD` as the superuser command instead of `sudo`.
      -e ENVAR  Shell script with environment variable assignments which is
                uploaded and sourced on each HOST. Option may be specified
                multiple times. Files ending with .enc will be decrypted
                temporarily. If not specified, defaults to envars*sh envars*sh.enc
      -F FILE   SSH `-F` option.
      -h HOST   Target host. Option may be specified multiple times. The HOST may
                be preceded with USER@ to specify the remote user. If a host has
                a wildcard ('*'), then HOST is interpeted as a regular expression,
                with '*' replaced with '.*' and any matching hosts in the following
                files are added to the HOST list: /etc/ssh_config,
                /etc/ssh/ssh_config, ~/.ssh/config, /etc/ssh_known_hosts,
                /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts, ~/.ssh/known_hosts, and /etc/hosts.
      -i FILE   SSH `-i` option for identity file.
      -k        Keep the cube_exec.sh generated script.
      -l        Local execution. Instead of (or in addition to) `-h HOST`s or a
                sub-COMMAND, run the `-c` cubes or `COMMAND`s locally.
      -o K=V    SSH `-o` option. Option may be specified multiple times. Defaults
                to `-o ConnectTimeout=5`.
      -O P=V    Set the specified variable P with the value V. Option may be
                specified multiple times. Do not put double quotes around V. If
                V contains *, replace with matching hosts per the -h algorithm.
      -p PORT   SSH `-p` option.
      -P PWD    Password for decrypting .enc ENVAR files.
      -q        Quiet; minimize output.
      -r ROLE   Role name. Option may be specified multiple times.
      -R        Use `rsync` instead of scp.
      -s        Skip remote host initialization (making ~/.posixcube, uploading
                posixcube.sh, etc.). Assumes at least one run completed without -s.
                Does not support encrypted ENVAR files.
      -S        Run cube_package and cube_service APIs as superuser.

                includes this CUBE using cube_include.
      -v        Show version information.
      -w PWDF   File that contains the password for decrypting .enc ENVAR files.
                Defaults to ~/.posixcube.pwd
      -z SPEC   Use the SPEC set of options from the ./cubespecs.ini file
      -y        If a HOST returns a non-zero code, continue processing other HOSTs.
      COMMAND   Remote command to run on each HOST. Option may be specified
                multiple times. If no HOSTs are specified, available sub-commands:
                  edit: Decrypt, edit, and re-encrypt ENVAR file with $EDITOR.
                  show: Decrypt and print ENVAR file.
                  source: Source all ENVAR files. Must be run with
                          POSIXCUBE_SOURCED (see Public Variables section below).

    Description:

      posixcube.sh is used to execute CUBEs and/or COMMANDs on one or more HOSTs.
      
      A CUBE is a shell script or directory containing shell scripts. The CUBE
      is transferred to each HOST. If CUBE is a shell script, it's executed. If
      CUBE is a directory, a shell script of the same name in that directory
      is executed. In both cases, the directory is changed to the directory
      containing the script before execution so that you may reference files
      such as templates using relative paths.
      
      An ENVAR script is encouraged to use environment variable names of the form
      cubevar_${uniquecontext}_envar="value". If a CUBE directory contains the
      file `envars.sh`, it's sourced before anything else (including `-e ENVARs`).
      
      Both CUBEs and COMMANDs may execute any of the functions defined in the
      "Public APIs" in the posixcube.sh script. Short descriptions of the
      functions are in the APIs section below. See the source comments above each
      function for details.
      
    Examples (assuming posixcube.sh is on ${PATH}, or executed absolutely):

      posixcube.sh -h socrates uptime
      
        Run the `uptime` command on host `socrates`. This is not very different
        from ssh ${USER}@socrates uptime, except that COMMANDs (`uptime`) have
        access to the cube_* public functions.
      
      posixcube.sh -h socrates -c test.sh
      
        Run the `test.sh` script (CUBE) on host `socrates`. The script has
        access to the cube_* public functions.
      
      posixcube.sh -h socrates -c test
      
        Upload the entire `test` directory (CUBE) to the host `socrates` and
        then execute the `test.sh` script within that directory (the name
        of the script is expected to be the same as the name of the CUBE). This
        allows for easily packaging other scripts and resources needed by
        `test.sh`.
      
      posixcube.sh -S -h plato@socrates cube_package install atop
      
        As the remote user `plato` on the host `socrates`, install the package
        `atop`. The `-S` option is required to run the commands within
        cube_package as the superuser (see the Philosophy section, #3).
      
      posixcube.sh -h root@socrates -h seneca uptime
      
        Run the `uptime` command on hosts `socrates` and `seneca`
        as the user `root`.
      
      posixcube.sh -h web*.test.com uptime
      
        Run the `uptime` command on all hosts matching the regular expression
        web.*.test.com in the SSH configuration files.
      
      sudo posixcube.sh -b && . /etc/bash_completion.d/posixcube_completion.sh
      
        For Bash users, install a programmable completion script to support tab
        auto-completion of hosts from SSH configuration files.

      posixcube.sh -e production.sh.enc show
      
        Decrypt and show the contents of production.sh
      
      posixcube.sh -e production.sh.enc edit
      
        Decrypt, edit, and re-encrypt the contents of production.sh with $EDITOR

      posixcube.sh -i ~/.ssh/plato -o LogLevel=VERBOSE -o ConnectTimeout=30 \
                  -h plato@socrates uptime
      
        Run the `uptime` command on host `socrates` as the remote user `plato`
        using the SSH identity file ~/.ssh/plato and specifying the SSH options
        LogLevel=VERBOSE and ConnectTimeout=30
      
    Philosophy:

      1. Fail hard and fast. In principle, a well written script would check ${?}
      after each command and either gracefully handle it, or report an error.
      Few people write scripts this well, so we enforce this check (using
      `cube_check_return` within all APIs) and we encourage you to do the same;
      for example, `touch /etc/fstab || cube_check_return`. All cube_*
      APIs are guaranteed to do their own checks, so you don't have to do this
      for those calls; however, note that if you're executing a cube_* API in a
      sub-shell, although any failures will be reported by cube_check_return,
      the script will continue unless you also check the return of the sub-shell.
      For example: $(cube_readlink /etc/localtime) || cube_check_return
      
      With this strategy, unfortunately, piping becomes more difficult. There are
      non-standard mechanisms like pipefail and PIPESTATUS, but the standardized
      approach is to run each command separately and check the status. For example:
      
      cubevar_app_x="$(cmd1)" || cube_check_return
      cubevar_app_y="$(printf '%s' "${cubevar_app_x}" | cmd2)" || cube_check_return
      
      2. We don't use `set -e` because some functions may handle all errors
      internally (with `cube_check_return`) and use a positive return code as a
      "benign" result (e.g. `cube_set_file_contents`). We don't use `set -u`
      because we source in the user's scripts and they may not want this behavior.
      
      3. Recent versions of many distributions encourage running most commands
      as a non-superuser, and then using `sudo` if needed, with some distributions
      disallowing remote SSH using the `root` account by default. First, the `sudo`
      command is not standardized (see https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/48553).
      Moreoever, it is not enough to prefix posixcube APIs with `sudo` because
      `sudo` doesn't pass along functions (even if they're exported and `sudo` is
      executed with --preserve-env). `su -c` may be used but it requires
      password input. For the most common use case of requiring `sudo` for
      cube_package and cube_service, if `-S` is specified, the commands within
      those APIs are executed using `sudo`. If you need to run something else as a
      superuser and you need access to the posixcube APIs, see the `cube_sudo` API.

    Frequently Asked Questions:

      * Why is there a long delay between "Preparing hosts" and the first remote
        execution?
      
        You can see details of what's happening with the `-d` flag. By default,
        the script first loops through every host and ensures that ~/.posixcube/
        exists, then it transfers itself to the remote host. These two actions
        may be skipped with the `-s` parameter if you've already run the script
        at least once and your version of this script hasn't been updated. Next,
        the script loops through every host and transfers any CUBEs and a script
        containing the CUBEs and COMMANDs to run (`cube_exec.sh`). If the shell
        is detected to be `bash`, then the above occurs asynchronously across the
        HOSTs. Finally, you'll see the "Executing on HOST..." line and the real
        execution starts.

    Cube Development:

      Shell scripts don't have scoping, so to reduce the chances of function name
      conflicts, name functions cube_${cubename}_${function} and name variables
      cubevar_${cubename}_${var}.

    Public APIs:
      
      * cube_echo

          (defaults to `id_rsa`) for the user $3 (defaults to `cube_current_user`)
          Example: cube_user_ensure_private_key "${cubevar_app_key1_private}"
      
      * cube_user_ensure_authorized_public_key
          Ensure the SSH public key contents $1 exist in the `.ssh/authorized_keys`
          file in the home directory of user $2 (defaults to `cube_current_user`)
          Example: cube_user_ensure_authorized_public_key "${cubevar_app_key1_pub}"
      
      * cube_user_authorize_known_host
          Ensure the public key(s) of the host $1 are in the `.ssh/known_hosts` file
          in the home directory of user $2 (defaults to `cube_current_user`). Note:
          the fingerprints are currently not checked, but you may review STDOUT.
          To reduce the risks of MITM attacks, you can call this only after a
          successful call to `cube_user_ensure_private_key` so that the scan is
          only done once on private key setup.
          Example: cube_user_ensure_private_key "${cubevar_app_host_privkey}" && \
                    cube_user_authorize_known_host some_host
      
    Public Variables:

      * POSIXCUBE_APIS_ONLY
          Set this to any value to only source the public APIs in posixcube.sh.
          Example: POSIXCUBE_APIS_ONLY=true . posixcube.sh && cube_echo \
                    $(cube_random_number 10)
      
      * POSIXCUBE_SOURCED
          Set this to any value to only run a sub-COMMAND, most commonly `source`,
          to source in all ENVAR files, but skip actual execution of posixcube.
          Example: POSIXCUBE_SOURCED=true . posixcube.sh source; \
                    POSIXCUBE_SOURCED= ; cube_echo Test
